      <h2>Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol (TCP-IP)</h2>
      <p>a suite of communication protocols that enables devices to communicate over networks, including the internet, by defining how data is packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. </p>

      <h2>Network Protocols</h2>
      <p>a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted and exchanged between devices on a network, enabling them to communicate effectively, regardless of their underlying hardware or software. </p>


      <h2>Computer Network</h2>
      <p>the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted over the internet, using a 32-bit address system. </p>

      <h2>IPv4</h2>
      <p></p>

      <h2>IPv6</h2>
      <p>the latest version of the Internet protocol, designed to address the issue of IPv4 address depletion by providing a much larger address space, enabling more devices to connect to the internet. </p>

      <h2>Domain Name Services (DNS)</h2>
      <p>a crucial part of the internet that translates human-readable domain names (like "www.example.com") into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate.</p>

      <h2>OSI Model</h2>
      <p>a conceptual framework that describes how data travels from one application to another across a network, breaking down network communication into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions. </p>

      <h2>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2>
      <p>a method employing encryption to provide secure access to a remote computer over the internet</p>
