            <h2>Pattern Recognition</h2>
            <p> a data analysis method that uses machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize patterns and regularities in data.</p>

            <h2>Mathematic Operators</h2>
            <p>used for mathematical and technical operators' representation in an HTML document.</p>

            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <p>a way of repeating the same block of code over and over.</p>

            <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
            <p>A conditional statement begins with an "if" statement to determine if an action should be taken.</p>

            <h2>Algorithmic Thinking</h2>
            <p>the construction of an algorithm, or step-by-step process for solving a problem and similar problems.</p>

            <h2>Relational Operators</h2>
            <p>a programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities.</p>

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>The &gt;var&lt; tag is used to defines a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression.</p>

            <h2>Decomposition</h2>
            <p>splitting it into more functions.</p>

            <h2>Refactoring</h2>
            <p>the process of restructuring code, while not changing its original functionality.</p>

            <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
            <p>The value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator.</p>

            <h2>Abstraction</h2>
            <p>you're not interacting with the code itself, you're interacting with visual representations of the code.</p>

            <h2>Branching</h2>
            <p>designing different routes through the content, depending on input from the user.</p>

            <h2>asynchronous and synchronous</h2>
            <p>Synchronous means happening at the same time. Asynchronous is the oppositeâ€”not happening at the same time</p>
